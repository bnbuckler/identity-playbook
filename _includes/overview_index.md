# Overview of Digital Identity Collection and Sharing
---------------------

The information presented in this section is intended to provide agencies with a [summary of digital identity](../1_enterprise-id). It also includes an overview of how identity data should be shared using an [Authoritative Attribute Exchange Service (AAES)](../12_ae-elements). The overview section is meant to provide readers with a brief description of what a digital identity entails and what an AAES is, what it can be used for, and the basic elements of an AAES.

More detailed information about digital identity and the AAES can be found in the Plan, Design, and Implement sections.
