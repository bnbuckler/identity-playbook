# Plan Your Digital Identity Collection and Sharing Process
--------------------------------------------

Before implementing an AAES to store and share identity data, agencies will need to establish plans for some key elements of the identity proofing process: 

<br>

[Core Identity Attributes](../id-attributes)  

Determine which identity attributes that, when combined together, can uniquely identify a person within the agency and execute proper access control decisions. It is recommended to leverage the government-wide Core Person Model as a baseline of core identity attributes, but agencies should determine which core attributes would best fit their business needs.

<br>

[Authoritative Data Sources](../auth-sources) 

Agencies should determine which systems will be considered the most reliable and accurate source of identity data within the organization.

<br>

[Digital Identity Process Integration](../id-integration) 

Agencies should look at how their identity management processes (e.g., HR processing, background investigations, contractor processing) can be integrated and streamlined to reduce the number of data collection points, eliminate redundancy, and minimize the use of paper-based forms for identity data collection.
