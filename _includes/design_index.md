# Design Your Digtial Identity Collection and Sharing Process
--------------------------------------

When designing an AAES to integrate and streamline collection of digital identity data, there are numerous components to consider in order to make the identity collection process as streamlined and efficient as possible. These components include:

<br>

[Managing Digital Identity Records](../1_manage-records)

To eliminate duplicate and/or redundant identity data collection, agencies should establish a process to link identity attributes to the appropriate record. This section describes the approaches agencies can take to meet this goal, including unique person identifiers, multi-attribute keys, and manual identity attribute correlation.

<br>

[AAES Architecture](../2_aaes-arch)


Agencies must determine how they will integrate an AAES capability with existing IT infrastructure. This section serves as an overview of approaches an agency can take when implementing their AAES solution.

<br>

[AAES Solution Components](../3_aaes-solutions)

In the AAES infrastructure, there are two main components:  Authoritative Attribute Manager (AAM) and the Authoritative Attribute Distributor. This section discusses the functionality and approaches for implementing the two components.

[AAES Common Design Characteristics](../4_aaes-design)

There are several design characteristics that an agency should include when designing their AAES architecture.
