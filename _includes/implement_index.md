# Implement Your Digital Identity Collection and Sharing Process
---------------------

The Implement section is intended to provide agencies with specific [considerations](../aaes-implement) when deploying an AAES capability. These considerations include, but are not limited to:

<br>

* **Data Quality** - Data coming out of the AAES is only as good as the data put into the system.

<br>

* **Sensitivity of Data** - It is critical that proper access controls are in place to ensure sensitive identity data is protected.

<br>

* **Governance of Attribute Sharing** - Guidelines should be established to protect against unauthorized sharing of identity information.

<br>

* **Normalization**  - Creating a consistent classification for attributes allows an agency to enable more effective attribute sharing.
