# Introduction
---------------------

The Implement section is intended to provide agencies with specific considerations when deploying an AAES capability. These considerations include, but are not limited to:

**Data Quality** - Data coming out of the AAES is only as good as the data put into the system.

**Sensitivity of Data** - It is critical that proper access controls are in place to ensure sensitive identity data is protected.

**Governance of Attribute Sharing** - Guidelines should be established to protect against unauthorized sharing of identity information.

**Normalization** - Creating a consistent classification for attributes allows an agency to enable more effective attribute sharing.
