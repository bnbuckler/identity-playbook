---------------------------------------

An agency collects digital identity data for individuals (i.e., employees, contractors, and individuals with staff-like access) in order to support the agency's core business operations, issue credentials, and administer access to an agency's physical and logical resources. Therefore, in order to ensure that access control decisions across the agency are based on accurate and current information, digital identity data must be reliably managed over time.

To support this need, the FICAM architecture emphasizes the importance of an enterprise digital identity. The enterprise digital identity is a single digital representation of an individual's identity, maintained at an enterprise level, which uses attributes from authoritative source systems. This goal differs from many agency environments, where agencies often rely on locally managed user identity accounts comprised of redundantly collected identity attributes. 

Throughout this playbook, agencies will find answers to several common digital identity questions, including:

* How do I determine what identity attributes are needed to identify a person within my agency?
* How do I discover or locate authoritative data sources for particular identity data attributes in my agency?
* How are authoritative data sources designated and protected?
* What approaches exist to help my agency manage digital identities more effectively?
