Agencies collect identity data through a number of disparate processes that are conducted by offices and groups throughout the organization. These include new hire on-boarding, background investigation processing, credentialing, and access control administration. Typically, each of these processes is a manual, separate, and often redundant point for obtaining identity data. 

The FICAM architecture seeks to streamline and integrate digital identity management processes and minimize the number of collection points for identity data, while reducing or eliminating the use of paper-based forms as identity data collection methods. These improvements are expected to help agencies achieve greater process efficiency and improve the security and privacy around the collection and maintenance of digital identity data. 

The information and guidance presented in this section is intended to assist agencies in providing answers to several common digital identity process integration questions, including:

* What steps can my agency take to streamline and integrate the backend processes that are used to collect and manage digital identity data?

* What can my agency do to streamline and integrate the HR and on-boarding processes that are used to collect identity data?

* How can my agency better integrate the background investigation process to eliminate redundant data collection?

* What steps can my agency take to streamline the processes for managing contractor identity data?

|-------------------------------|
| Electronic security methods (e.g., encryption, role-based access control, etc.), when deployed as part of an agency's overall security program, can be more efficient, more reliable, and less expensive than traditional methods (e.g., locked rooms, filing cabinets, etc.) for protecting sensitive data. However, an agency should consult with its Privacy Offer to ensure that these electronic methods adhere to privacy laws, directives, and policies. |

Once the core person attributes are established and authoritative data sources are defined, agencies should analyze the backend processes that are used to obtain identity data to determine where processes can be enhanced and improved. Per OMB Circular A-123, management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal controls to achieve the objectives of effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This responsibility is also held by ICAM implementers, who are accountable for improving the effectiveness, quality, and productivity of federal programs and operations. 

The goals of OMB Circular A-123 closely align with the effort to improve the processes within an agency that collect identity data, described in the table below.

By performing a thorough analysis of backend processes and taking steps to achieve a tighter integration of identity processes, agencies can expect to see a number of benefits, including: 

* **Increased levels of process efficiency.** The need to manually collect and manage data significantly decreases, allowing agencies to focus on core business functions.

* **Cost savings.** Reducing the number of hours spent collecting, managing, and reconciling identity data, along with fewer required systems and processes to store and maintain data will lead to lower costs.

* **Enhanced security and privacy.** Integrating digital identity creation processes results in fewer collection points, reducing opportunities for data leakage and/or theft through automated access control to identity data. Furthermore, eliminating paper-based collection methods also reduces additional security and space requirements associated with storing and securing paper files.

* **Enhanced compliance with Federal regulations and guidance.** The tight integration of the digital identity creation processes and elimination of paper-based collection methods helps agencies comply with the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA).

### Streamlining HR Processing

Within many agencies, the Human Resources (HR) department is typically the primary source of person data for federal employees. HR is usually the first group within an agency to receive an individual's identity information, often through the job application and employee on-boarding processes. By targeting integration and streamlining of these HR processes, an agency can see significant benefits to user life cycle management.

There are specific steps that agencies can take to achieve this, including:

* **Streamlining data exchange.** Integrating agency recruiting systems with government-wide applications can enable pre-population of on-boarding data provided by the applicant during the recruiting process. 

* **Digitizing the on-boarding process.** Agencies should allow employees to complete and track the progress of HR on-boarding forms online.

* **Integrating various HR systems.** Systems used by an agency's HR department and the bureau/component level may operate separately to perform the same business processes, such as recruiting and on-boarding. These systems should be consolidated to eliminate redundant data collection and management. 

* **Leveraging digital signatures.** The use of digital signatures allows an agency to more easily detect forgery or tampering by verifying that a form  was created by a known person.

* **Establishing an employee self-service portal.** Agencies should set up an online capability that allows employees to securely update their data, such as address, emergency contacts, and direct deposit account information. These data changes would ideally be populated downstream to reliant systems.

### Streamlining Background Investigation Processing

Data collected during a background investigation readily contains a person's core digital identity. By integrating and streamlining personnel security and background investigation processes, the processes around creating and populating the digital identity can be dramatically improved. Agencies have several opportunities to accomplish this, including: 

* **Leveraging data captured during the PIV enrollment process.** Capturing data once and reusing it creates a more efficient process, while a limited number of data collection points enhances data privacy. For example, many biographic data elements (e.g., name, DOB) collected during PIV enrollment can also be used during the background investigation to reduce redundancy. 

* **Integrate background investigation processing into other processes.** The number of steps necessary to initiate a background investigation can be reduced by integrating this process with other existing business processes. For example, instead of manually tracking the due dates for reinvestigations, consider building a system that automatically tracks reinvestigation dates and prompts the personnel security specialist to initiate reinvestigations at the appropriate time. 

* **Leveraging authoritative sources of identity information.** Agencies  should use their internal authoritative sources of identity data (e.g., HR systems) and share this information with the systems and applications that are used to track and conduct investigations (e.g., OPM‘s e-QIP). Doing so can minimize the amount of identity data that must be manually re-entered during the background investigation process.

* **Eliminating paper-based investigative forms.** Agencies should strive to eliminate the use of paper forms and manual processes to support investigation processing through OPM. Agencies should also use automated electronic processing solutions, such as OPM‘s electronic Agency Delivery of investigative results.

* **Honoring reciprocity for investigations performed by other agencies.**  The FICAM architecture identifies the lack of reciprocity in accepting background investigations completed by or on behalf of another agency as a key gap in performing background investigations. An agency should utilize the capabilities provided within the Central Verification System (CVS) to report and view background investigation adjudication results.

The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is responsible for maintaining the CVS database. The CVS stores information related to security clearance, suitability, and access decisions for contractor personnel. OPM also houses data related to credentialing determinations under HSPD-12, suitability or fitness for federal employment, fitness for contractor employees, and eligibility for access to classified information to facilitate reciprocity.

An agency's responsibilities with regard to use of CVS include the following:

* Report all adjudicative decisions on background investigations to OPM.

* Supply bulk records and HSPD-12 information to CVS via transaction files through the OPM Secure Portal, or through individual entries through the Personnel Investigations Processing System (PIPS) Agency Menu.

* Make daily updates to their information in CVS to report any changes, such as adding new clearances, noting revocations, denials, suspensions, and those clearances which were administratively withdrawn. In addition, agencies are required to fully refresh their CVS clearance data at least monthly.

* Before initiating a new background investigation request, consult CVS to determine if an existing investigation is sufficient to meet the agency's needs.

* Take steps to ensure the accuracy and maintenance of the information provided to CVS, since OPM does not own this information and other agencies may rely on it to make credentialing decisions. 

* Ensure that the appropriate data elements are entered into CVS for each applicable record (e.g., name, DOB, investigation, clearance level, status, etc.).

### Streamlining Contractor Processing

Although contractors may require similar access to federal employees, the methods and locations for collecting and maintaining their identity data are often very different. Digital identities for the contractor population can be challenging to manage due to a number of factors, including:

* Previously, managing identity data for contractors has not been required to support contracting business functions, unless required based on the nature of the contract.

* Where it is collected to support access, contractor information is often obtained through a variety of disparate processes and managed separately for individual resources. 

* Many agencies do not have existing authoritative sources for contractor identity data.

* The contractor population is fluid, as individuals often change the projects, bureau/component, or agencies they are affiliated with.

In order to overcome these challenges, an agency should establish a process for managing contractor identity data for contractors who require identity credentials and access to agency resources. By doing this, agencies can achieve similar efficiencies and cost savings associated with improved employee data management. 

An agency should consider the following when streamlining the processes for collecting contractor identity data:

* **Enhanced on-boarding process.** Agencies should replace manual, paper-based forms and processes with digital methods (e.g., digital signatures, online portals) wherever possible during the contractor on-boarding process. This process should be communicated to and followed by all relevant parties so that there is no ambiguity in the way contractors are introduced into the agency. 

* **Single collection point.** Within the streamlined on-boarding process, agencies should minimize the points at which contractor data is collected. If possible, there should be one step in the on-boarding process where contractors provide their identity data, such as the background investigation process. A single collection point will help eliminate redundancy, increase efficiency, and ease management of contractor information.

* **Gaps in contractor data.** After deciding where contractor information will be collected, agencies should compare the data elements to the Core Person Model and identify discrepancies. It is beneficial for agencies to have consistent attributes across all groups within their population, so agencies should ensure that they collect similar information from contractors when creating their digital identity.

* **Authoritative source.** Typically, agencies do not have a single authoritative source for contractors, which can make management of their data challenging. Agencies should establish an authoritative source for contractors by either creating a separate repository or tying it into an existing system that holds employee data (e.g., IDMS).

* **Data retention.** Since contractors typically begin and end many different contracts while working with an agency, agencies should analyze their options for retaining contractor data after the contract ends. Agencies should determine a length of time for maintaining contractor data in their systems that is cost-effective and compliant with the Fair Information Privacy Principle of data minimization.

* **Account and status changes.**  Agencies should establish a process for making changes to contractor information that uses current workflows and business processes. Agencies could also consider implementing a self-service portal that allows authorized individuals to make changes to their identity information and status. This option could improve data integrity and reduce the burden on the agency‘s support staff.

* **Enhanced off-boarding process.**  Agencies should establish a streamlined process for managing contractor identity records as they end their work with the agency. This process should be communicated to and followed by all relevant parties so that there is no ambiguity in the way contractors are released from the agency. The responsibility for completing this off-boarding process should be assigned to a specific person (e.g., sponsor) or office (e.g., personnel security). 

* **PIV card collection.** Contractors' PIV cards must be collected during the off-boarding process. Not collecting a PIV card can have a number of negative impacts on the agency including security risks, inaccurate information on the status of their contractor population, and unnecessary costs for the management of their PIV card ($3 per month per card for the GSA Managed Service Office).

* **Contract requirement.** A requirement should be incorporated into contracts requiring that all government property, including PIV cards, be returned when the contract is completed.

* **Policy.** Agencies should establish a policy that details the approach for collecting and managing contractor identity data. This policy should be communicated across the agency and included in all contracts.
